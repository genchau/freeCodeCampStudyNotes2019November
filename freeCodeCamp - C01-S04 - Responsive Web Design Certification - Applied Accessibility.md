C01-S04-L20 - Responsive Web Design Certification - Applied Accessibility - Make Links Navigable with HTML Access Keys

```
<button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>

C01-S04-L21 - Responsive Web Design Certification - Applied Accessibility - Use tabindex to Add Keyboard Focus to an Element

```
  p:focus {
    background-color: yellow;
  }

tabindex="0"

```

This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0"
Note: A negative tabindex value (typically -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. 
Bonus - using tabindex also enables the CSS pseudo-class :focus to work on the p tag.

C01-S04-L22 - Responsive Web Design Certification - Applied Accessibility - Use tabindex to Specify the Order of Keyboard Focus for Several Elements

```
<div tabindex="1">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!</div>
<div tabindex="2">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!</div>
```

Setting a tabindex="1" will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence of specified tabindex values (2, 3, etc.), before moving to default and tabindex="0" items.
